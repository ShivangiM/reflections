When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It could be shared with many and can be accessed easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	It will become mess.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Fork is like clone but on github. Clone will download the repository from any site 	in your local directory or even from one local directory to other. Branch is a 		different path to make changes and check them without making changes in master 		branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	helps at time of merging
