How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It was  precise, so it became quite easy to compare.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I don't need to remember the changes or different file names.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    As this is judegmental, it might happen somtimes I forget to add commit and
    then it will create a problem, but I think its fine as after using it for 
    sometime I will get use to it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is particulaly developed keeping programmers in mind. Many files are interconnected so its a good idea, but Google Docs doesn't need to provide â€ his functionality its rare that files withing folder would be linked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the commits and git diff shows difference between them..

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know I can go back and find mistakes if done at all.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try git for every project, and want to contribute max to opensource 
    projects.
